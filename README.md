CS-305: Software Security
    Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis financial is a consulting company, which means that they make financial plans for people. In project one, I had to find any vulnerabiities in their existing software. In project two, I had to pick and deploy an algorithm cipher that Artemis Fianncial will use for data verification.

    What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
I had weaknesses, but I was good at spotting code quality and input validation issues. It is important to code securely because if code is insecure, the consequences could be catastrophic. The company could lose millions, user data could be compromised, or people could lsoe their lives, depending on the software in question. A company's overall wellbeing could be tanked in an instant if a vulnerability is exploited.

    Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
I struggled with expectations. I had the flowchart telling me which areas of security to check, but I didn't know exactly what I had to check for all of them. So: the flowchart was both helpful and unhelpful. I wish it had a bit of explanation in each section.

    How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I added an algorithm cipher to the code in project two. This will ensure that data is encrypted, which checks off cryptography as a requirement. I aslo added comments to my code to ensure that other developers could understand it. In project onw, I made recommendations, mostly surrounding code quality, code errors, and encapsulation.

    How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I ran the dependency check, and I double checked the vulnerability assessment process flow.

    What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I used GeeksforGeeks a lot in this course, because they offer succinct explanations for complicated concepts. I will likely use GeeksforGeeks as a resource in future courses as well. To understand algorithm ciphers, these videos were helpful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4xNJsjtN6E , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMtFhACPnTY&t=57s . I might look at his channel to learn more about different algorithms.

    Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would show them this assignment to demonstrate that I know how to preform a vulnerability assessment, and that I know how to read a dependency check report, if this ever comes up.
